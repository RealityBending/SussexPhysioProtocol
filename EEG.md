## Informed Consent Form

| EEG| 
| --- |
| EEG (Electroencephalography) is a method of recording electrical activity in the brain, providing an electrogram representation of brain waves. This is achieved by placing electrodes around the head to measure electrical conductance. In our study, we will be using electrodes on the forehead and behind the ears to capture the electrogram from two different sites. In some cases, a slightly damp cloth may be used to increase conductance and improve the quality of the recorded data. <br/><br/> To measure EEG, we will utilize the Muse 2 headset. Although this headset is commercially available for meditation purposes, it will be used exclusively for research in our study. Therefore, we will not be able to provide feedback or information on clinical aspects of the data obtained. The Muse 2 headset is lightweight and non-intrusive, ensuring a comfortable experience during the recording session. If you have long hair, we recommend bringing a hairband to ensure unobstructed contact between the electrodes and your skin.|

## Protocol in Ethics Application

| EEG Recording | 
| --- |
|Electroencephalography (EEG) will be conducted using the Muse 2 headset, a lightweight and non-intrusive device. The headset is designed to be worn comfortably behind the ears and on the forehead, utilizing four electrodes to capture electrical signals from the brain's temporal and frontal lobes. Specifically, the four channels (TP9, TP19, AF7, and AF8) will be recorded using dry electrodes placed at these sites. <br/><br/> The Muse 2 headset is a commercially available device commonly used for capturing meditation biomarkers, and it poses no risk or harm to the participants. It employs non-invasive dry electrodes, ensuring a safe and comfortable data collection experience. In rare instances where the received signal is too weak to be useful, researchers may enhance skin conductance by gently rubbing a slightly damp cloth across the forehead and behind the ears. However, this step is typically unnecessary and, if needed, can be performed by the participants themselves. <br/><br/> Following data collection, the researcher will collect the Muse 2 headset and sanitize it appropriately before its subsequent use. These measures ensure the maintenance of hygiene standards and the participants' well-being throughout the research process. |


## Equipment Details

### Muse 2

The Muse 2 headset is a reliable and versatile tool for gathering EEG (Electroencephalography) and other physiological data. With its high-quality sensors, researchers can capture and analyse electrical brain activity in real-time or record and store to analyse later. It offers a lightweight and comfortable design for participants, facilitating non-intrusive and longer data collection sessions. Using two electrodes on the front headband of the device aswell as two behind the ear sensors, the Muse 2 headset can record EEG data from the frontal and temporal lobes. On top of its EEG capabilities, the headband tracks heart rate (PPG + Pulse Oximetry), angular velocity (gyroscope), proper acceleration (accelerometer) making this lightweight headset a powerful tool for gathering a range of physiological data without a lengthy setup or making the participant feel uncomfortable with multiple intrusive sensors. The Muse 2 headset has potential uses in various research applications, including cognitive neuroscience, neurofeedback, meditation research, and sleep studies.
